## Dumb Data Science - Hardee's and Carl's Jr
The year is 2009. I am on a road trip with my Boy Scout troop to Philmont, NM. Somewhere along the way, we visit our first Carl's Jr. for lunch, noting how strange it is to see the familiar Hardee's advertising with a different name. 

Another scout remarks "One day I'd like to eat at a Hardee's and [use the bathroom] in a Carl's Jr."

This led to a few minutes of speculation about how which Hardee's and Carl's Jr. are closest, and if it was even feasible to make such an attempt driving. 

The logistics of this question lodged themselves deeply in my 14 year old brain, and what better way to practice webscraping, eda, and optimization than this (dumb) question. 


The goal is to answer the following: 

-What is the general distrubution of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. restaurants in the United States?
-What single one-way path is the shortest between a Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, ignoring geographical features such as lakes, mountains, etc?
